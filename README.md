# fasta.el

Mode for working with [fasta
files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format).

## Commentary:

`fasta.el` implements a simple major mode for viewing and editing fasta
files. It's not designed to be anything too clever, I just wrote it to make
fasta files look nicer in Emacs.

## Todo:

- [ ] Sequence filling (as in wrapping).
- [ ] Sequence un-filling (for monsters who like it all on one line).
- [ ] Handle highlighting amino acids.
